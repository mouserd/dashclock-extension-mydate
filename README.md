## <img src="res/drawable-ldpi/ic_launcher.png"> DashClock Date Extension

[DashClock Date Extension](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pixelus.dashclock.ext.mydate) 
is an extension for the 
[DashClock Widget](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.nurik.roman.dashclock) from Roman Nurik.

If you're like me and prefer to hide the default DashClock date and time because it appears in the status bar then 
this is the extension for you.  This extension simply displays your devices' current date.

## Technical Details

This application is built using the [Maven Android Plugin](https://code.google.com/p/maven-android-plugin/).  See the 
[Getting Started Guide](https://code.google.com/p/maven-android-plugin/wiki/GettingStarted) for required environment 
pre-requisites and steps.

### Building a DEVELOPMENT apk:

To build a development apk, use the maven goal:
```
mvn clean install
```

### Deploying an apk to your device/emulator:

To deploy an apk to your connected device or emulator, use the maven goal:
```
mvn android:deploy
```

### Building a RELEASE apk:

When building a release version of the application, the generated artifacts will be suitable for uploading directly into 
the Google Playstore.  As such, the release build process will ensure that the code is shrunk, optimized and obfuscated
(using proguard), signed (certificate not included with this repo), and zip-aligned.  The resulting 
`target/date-signed-aligned.apk` is then ready for upload into the playstore.  To initiate a new release, simply:

1. Bump maven version:  
   Update `pom.xml` to increment the applications version  
   
2. Bump the android version:  
   Update `AndroidManifest.xml` so that the application `versionName` and `versionCode` are incremented appropriately.
     
3. Commit the changes from steps 1 and 2 to source control  

4. Build a **release** apk using maven:  
   ```
   mvn clean install -P release
   ```
